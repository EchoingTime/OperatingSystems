| 		The EvaluateExpression class is a program that takes 	|
|	an expression given by the user and with accordance to		|
| 	order of precedence, prints out the operations formatted 	|
|	like a tree data structure, but utilizing stacks. The 		|
|	program will also print out the correct solution of the 	|
|	expression. This program is for simple operations only, 	|
|	such as multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction,|
|	expressions provided by the user must be in InFlix form 	|
|	((e.g. 5 + 2 / 10 + 3), and	the expression must contain 	|
|	single-digit values (e.g. no greater than 9)				|
|																|
|		The Evaluator class is responsible for running the		|
|	EvaluateExpression class.									|
|																|
|		One running the Evaluator class, the user will be 		|
|	prompted to input an expression. The user must follow		|
|	the following rules:										|
|																|
|		1. Simple operations only (*, /, +, and -)				|
|		2. Must be in InFlix Expression form (e.g. 2 / 10 + 3)	|
|		3. Deals with single digit numbers 						|
|		(e.g. Don't do any value no greater than 9)				|
| 																|
|		Note: The user has to follow the above rules for the	|
|	program to work as intended. Future upgrades could include	|
|	proper formatting of expressions and solutions in a tree	|
|	form along with the ability to have more complex operations	|
|	(e.g. ^, (), etc) and values greater than 9. 				|
